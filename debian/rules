# Note: 'make install' will set .revision-hash to the revision number
# of the debian branch, not of the upstream branch (see source/options).
# This is deliberate.

# TODO: the build is not reproducible: .revision-hash is set to $(git rev-parse
# HEAD) when building from the package's git, but to $(cat .revision-hash)
# when building outside git â€” which is normally the contents of .revision-hash
# in the upstream tarball.
#
# Building twice inside git will give the same results both times;
# Building twice outside git will also give the same results both times;
# but the first pair will be different from the second pair.
#
# The "outside" build runs only 'dpkg-source' inside the package's git, and
# that (for the "3.0 (quilt)" source/format) in turn only runs the quilt
# series.  Ideally, somehow running the quilt series will patch .revision-hash
# with the hash of the package's git repository revision being built...
